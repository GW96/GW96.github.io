As a PhD student in systems engineering at Arizona State University, my research focuses on connected and automated vehicles, cooperative control, and vehicle dynamics and design. My goal is to use cooperative control to improve the efficiency, safety, and sustainability of our transportation systems. I received my B.S. in Vehicle Engineering from Dalian Jiaotong University in 2018 and my M.S. in Transportation Engineering from Tongji University in 2021.

I am the author or co-author of more than 8 peer-reviewed publications, and I have received several awards and scholarships, including the National Scholarship, National Encouragement Scholarship, and National Second Prize of the China Post-Graduate Mathematical Contest in Modeling. I am dedicated to finding innovative solutions in the field of transportation engineering, and I am excited to continue my academic journey as a PhD student at ASU.
